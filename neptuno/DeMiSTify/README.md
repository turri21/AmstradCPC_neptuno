# DeMiSTify
Support code intended to assist in the porting of MiST FPGA cores
to other target boards, specifically the Turbo Chameleon 64 cartridges.
Copyright (c) 2021 by Alastair M. Robinson

## Please note
If you use this project to port a MiST FPGA core to a new board, please
respect the license of this project and also of the core being ported.

Generally, this means you are obliged to supply on request the full
source and project files which correspond to any binary release (whether
that binary takes the form of a file, or is pre-programmed into a chip)
to anyone who has received the binary - or better yet, if the binary is
available for download make the source available for download from the
same place.
